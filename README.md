Custom links for [Virtual Radar Server](https://www.virtualradarserver.co.uk "Virtual Radar Server's Homepage") (a.k.a. VRS). This plug-in add new links to the Detail panel, that may help identify new aircraft or find pictures to the existing ones.

##Prerequisites
- VRS installed and running
- VRS Custom Content Plugin installed and enabled.

##Instructions
- Clone or download the repo into a directory on the machine where VRS is running. Ensure you do not place the files under the Virtual Radar Server directory, since they could be overwritten on upgrades.
- Configure the VRS Custom Content Plugin to add the "CustomLink.js" file into the END of HEAD portion of the pages, with an " * " (without quotes and spaces) on the Address field, so it will populate the links on all pages (including reports).
- Enjoy!

##Acknowledgment (Agradecimentos)
This project was only possible thanks to the invaluable help of many individuals and communities, especially the creator of the VRS, Andrew Whewell, always solicitous in [his forum](https://forum.virtualradarserver.co.uk/); Andrew Hill, whose [flights.hillhome.org](http://flights.hillhome.org/) site inspired me deeply; and all of the [ADS-B Brasil](http://bradsb.com/forum/index.php) community, including Ramon Martins and Jaime Hempke, which together maintain the excellent site [TrafegoAereo.com](http://trafegoaereo.com/).
